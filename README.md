- ### To Load The Mod, Use Shield Client and Put The Mod in ``Call of Duty Black Ops 4\project-bo4\mods`` (Extract The Mod First!)
  #### or else you could use the [Injector](https://github.com/Jek47/BO4-GSC-Mods/tree/main/Tools/PC) (Make Sure to Inject the CSCC with all Players in The Party!, GSIC is Only For The Host!)

- ### Client Needed to Run This Mod: [Shield Client Launcher](https://github.com/bodnjenie14/Project_-bo4_Launcher)

- ### Edit Project/Shield Config and Set dev_funcs to true or else you will Crash!

```
